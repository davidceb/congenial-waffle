MIME is a standard that extends the format of email messages to support images, videos, audio, and app programs. The main goal of MIME is to enable the exchange of multimedia content through emails and HTTP. In HTML context, MIME is used to specify the type of source that is being linked.

The title attribute is unnecessary by a welcome addition. We are now encouraged to use the height and width of the actual image. The reason is that the web page will set aside space in the page for the image so that we avoid cumulative layout shift. It avoids clicking on the wrong thing like so many websites. Lastly, the loading="lazy" attribute and value make the image load only when getting close to it. Without it, the image would load as soon as we enter the web page and that would slow the browser down. This way it loads only when needed and conserves browser memory.-->
